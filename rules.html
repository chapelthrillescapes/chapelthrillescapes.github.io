                    1. Room 1.5 by Chapel Thrill Escapes is a series of challenging puzzles and games. All answers are real words derived from a variety of riddles. <br><br>
                    2. When you have an answer, replace the part of the URL before .html, like so: https://chapelthrillescapsed.github.io/<span style="font-weight:bold">answergoeshere</span>.html and search for your answer. <br><br>
                    3. Remove spaces from answers which have more than one word, and make sure your input is completely lowercase (no capitalization). <br><br>
                    4. We're here to help! We have hidden clues in some puzzles, but it's your job to find them. To access these clues, you must use a web browser like Firefox, Chrome, or Safari.
                    You may also need access to Google Maps and decoders (free online). <br><br>
                    5. If you find yourself stuck on a puzzle for some time, think about the puzzle in different ways or take a break and come back to play later. 
                    All answers are intuitive, there is no need to guess. <br><br>
                    6. The level number is always on the top left corner of the browser. <br><br>
                    7. Good luck! Let's begin!<br>
